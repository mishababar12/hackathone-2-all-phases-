## Prompt

all files according to specs are created or written properly ??

## Response snapshot

I've expanded the generic Phase 2 specification into a comprehensive document that mirrors the quality and structure of Phase 1, including user stories, priority levels, independent tests, edge cases, and measurable success criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High-quality specification established mirroring the project's established standards.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Updated phase-2-web/specs/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Ensuring the spec matches the detail level of Phase 1 is critical for successful SDD implementation in more complex phases.
