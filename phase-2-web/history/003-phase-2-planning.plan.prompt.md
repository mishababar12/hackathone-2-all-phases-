## Prompt

/sp.plan for the web application structure according to the requirements mentioned in the constitutuion file .

## Response snapshot

I've executed the implementation planning workflow for the Phase 2 Web Application. This included generating the primary Implementation Plan, a Research document for technical decisions, the Data Model schema, and a Quickstart guide for developers, all localized within the phase-2-web/ subdirectory.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architectural blueprint for Phase 2 implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Generated plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementable tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Maintained strict alignment with the constitutional requirement for distinct phases and SDD workflow.
